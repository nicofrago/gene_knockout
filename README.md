# Helical Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository analyzes gene knockouts and trains classification models on scGPT-generated embeddings. The dataset used is the helical yolk-sac dataset.

## Files
### gene_knockout.ipynb
Computes the impact of knocking out different genes to understand their roles in various processes.

### train.py
Trains a classification model using embeddings generated by scGPT.

### utils.py
Provides utility functions and helpers for data processing and analysis tasks.

## Usage
1. Run gene_knockout.ipynb to analyze the effect of removing specific genes.
2. Execute train.py to train the classification model.
3. Refer to utils.py for functionalities like plotting, and utility functions.
